    <h2>The secret butter that's worth it's weight in gold</h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever been out shopping at the grocery store and noticed a overly
      expensive type of butter that chooses to identify as irish? Well, the
      price increases for a reason, and the best way to make use of this golden
      block of dairy is to throw it in a pot of mashedpotatoes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Irish butter adds a sort of richness to the butter flavor, sort of like
      sharp cheddar to mild. Ofcourse, mashed potatoes are able to make full use
      of absorbing and dispersing all that great flavor!
