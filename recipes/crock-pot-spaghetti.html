    <h2>Spaghetti and meatballs that you can eat like bread pudding.</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti and meat balls go great with a ton of parmesan cheese, right?
      Well, except if your meatballs are tough, or the sauce turns out clumpy.
      Wouldn't it be great if you could just mush it all together and eat it
      like a sort of cake?
    </p>
    <p>
      That's where the crockpot comes in. Cooking spaghetti and meatballs in a
      crock pot low and slow can achieve this effect. Everything cooks together
      at the same heat, and after a few hours, it's all assured to be done,
      tender, and ready to eat!
